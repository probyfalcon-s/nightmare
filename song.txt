I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to do with this
These hands, this mind, this instability
From a cage I created, to a hell that heaven made
Can't let go of the hatred 'cause I love the way it tastes

I wouldn't take back a moment
Not one miserable moment
I'll give it all till there's nothing
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire
